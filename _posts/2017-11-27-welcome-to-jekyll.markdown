I don't know the real reason why I am writing this. I believe deep inside I do know my reasons, but somehow I can't bring myself to describe it in a straightforward manner. Maybe there's some sort of psychological barrier that prevents me from doing it, so I think I'd just explore my mind and list several possible reasons.

First, maybe I just want to simply accomplish a personal goal. I have been thinking a lot about doing this kind of writing. I had even attempted to do it several times, but sadly all of them ended in failure. The fact that I haven't yet done this has been bothering me a lot. I've planned it, thought about it, and yet why I still haven't done it yet? I feel like a failure for not having done it yet. Maybe now is the time.

Second, I once read in a book about writing that some people who attended the author's class wrote memoir in order to 'discover' about themselves and their relationship with other people. I believe that's also why I want to do this.

Third, there are a lot of things that I can't bring myself to discuss with other people. Most of these topics are considered too sensitive or taboo in the society I belong, and I can't discuss it with other people without drawing too much attention and causing potential dangers to myself.

Last, I think I simply want to record my current thoughts. As my life goes on I keep finding it harder and harder to relate my past selves. I can remember clearly what happened to them, but I can't remember what and how they thought.  It's as if they're strangers to me. Maybe writing my thoughts down will help my future self in learning how and what I was at various stages my life.

These are all of the possible reasons and expectations I can think right now of as to why I am writing. Maybe there are more, but right now I can't think of any. I hope I will learn much as I write and I will be able to fulfill the expectations which I have set upon myself.
